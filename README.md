# FruitBotsGame

Is a game where two robots (the green one is the user and the blue one has IA implemented) compete to see who picks more fruits on the board.

The game starts with an nxn board that has as its initial state fruits of a certain category distributed randomly on the board and the robots have the same random initial position. The goal is for each robot, to have collected more fruits in as many categories as possible.

The IA technique is **decision trees**.
